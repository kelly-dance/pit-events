# Pit Events Bot

Provides and an API for seeing upcoming events in pit. Is somewhat risky that the bot could get banned.

There is no public instance of this running, nor will there be because I do not wish to subvert Pit Supporter.

## Setup commands

`sudo docker build -t mcpqndq/pit-events .`

`docker run -p 5000:5000 -d mcpqndq/pit-events`

`sudo docker logs {id} -f`
