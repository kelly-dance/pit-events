# Pit Events Bot

Provides and an API for seeing upcoming events in pit. Is somewhat risky that the bot could get banned.

There is no public instance of this running, nor will there be because I do not wish to subvert Pit Supporter.

Currently, only supports Microsoft accounts. This is a trivial fix if someone wants to make a PR.

## Setup

Make a `.env` file with these properties:
```
EMAIL=account username or email
PASSWORD=account password
```
